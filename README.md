# Guess-the-word
This repository contains a coding project called "Guess the word". The program consists of a list of words that has been input by the programmer away from user's view.  In this game, a player will try and type a single letter each turn. The game allows player to see how many letters are in the word and each correct will show the location of the letter. The program will only take in letters, any other input(empty strings, numbers, or symbols) will not be accepted. To make this challenging, the player will have a limit amount of attempts until the game prints out the chosen random word.
